                      UWC3 Installation 
==============================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Included files and where they should go:

	Copy   UWC3.cfg     (to)  amxmodx/configs/UWC3
	Copy   sound/*      (to)  cstrike/sound (or) czero/sound
	Copy   sprites/*    (to)  cstrike/sprites
	Copy   models/*     (to)  cstrike/models


II. The following AMX Mod X modules must be loaded for UWC3 to run:
	NOTE: If you are using the latest 1.76b+ you do not need to edit
	      your modules.ini - they will be auto loaded for you.

	> fun
	> engine
	> cstrike
	> mysql
	> fakemeta

	Note for Windows Users: You *may* need to add this to the end of your server.cfg file
	exec addons/amxmodx/configs/UWC3/UWC3.cfg

	In most cases this will not be necessary
	
	
III. Editing Files
	Edit the uwc3.cfg file with your MySQL information and game play requirements
	
IV. Getting your UWC3 Build
	Now that you have the base files, go and get the specific UWC3 Build that you want to use.  What you have downloaded here
	is a "base pack" that is version independant.  These are the core models, sounds, sprites that go with the mod.  There are
	also a few different versions of uwc3 that may run more efficiently on different servers, and have different feature sets.
	Choose the one you want, and upload the plugin and the uwc3.cfg file associated with that release to the appropriate directory.
